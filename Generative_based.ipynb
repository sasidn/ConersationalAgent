This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair.

              "  'Anyone can post anything online. It\\'s up to the readers to think critically about information to decide if it seems helpful truthful or safe. Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn\\'t pass the test.   It\\'s so easy to spread information online and we can\\'t assume that the source we\\'re reading or watching is the original source. Before you can evaluate anything you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it\\'s a reliable source.   Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID19 illness include the World Health Organization WHO Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health and the BC Centre for Disease Control BCCDC. Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information.   Headlines and titles need to be simple and short so they can sometimes be misleading on their own. They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more.   Websites that belong to governments governmentfunded agencies wellknown health providers universities or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable. Be careful of sites that don\\'t list the author or don\\'t tell you much about themselves. Doublecheck the author and the credentials of any \\'experts\\' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed.   Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims? Does the author list their sources? Are the sources legitimate like research journals?   Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way: scared angry distrustful vulnerable. Phrases like \"Skyrocketing rates of infection\" are sensational and they\\'re meant to make people feel afraid. On the other hand factual statements like \"We have 50 new cases in BC\" give you important information without playing into your emotions. Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered.   Who is paying for the site? What products or services are being advertised? What links or other sites do they promote? Are you learning something from a story or experience or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service?   Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends especially as we practice physical distancing or selfisolation. Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community.   Like any other source of information it\\'s important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media. Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results. You\\'ll see both very poorquality sources next to goodquality sources and it\\'s up to you to decide which is which. In addition social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider. They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information.

Events like a pandemic change a lot over time and that uncertainty can add to fear and stress. The truth is that we don't know what will happen next—but that doesn't mean we're all helpless. You can do a lot. You can:   Map out a daily schedule including times you can connect with loved ones online or by phone   Plan out daily tasks and goals   Give yourself a schedule to look up current information   Make sure you have 14 days of healthy food and household supplies at home   Keep medications on hand and talk to your doctor for advice if you're at increased risk   Educate yourself on public health measures and figure out how you'll follow those instructions   Figure out how you'll manage increased childcare demands working for home or other changes to your usual routine   Determine if you'll need financial supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit or BC Temporary Rent Supplement if your job is affected by COVID19. If you anticipate a need you can find application instructions and gather any documents or other pieces of information ahead of time   Figure out how you'll manage times when you feel overwhelmed or hopeless like calming activities the number for a local support or crisis line a video chat with a loved one or a way to connect with your mental health care provider   Look for local support organizations neighbourhood groups or mutual aid groups if you need extra help or support or would like to help others in your community   Some planning will be straightforward but you may also encounter situations or times when it's harder to see a solution or good plan of action.

This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and selfisolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear.   Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example you might prefer a video chat over a phone call or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week.   Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help.   The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected problemsolve to see if you can find a solution.   Everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city are changing your circle of friends lost someone important in your life or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or selfisolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now.   Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons so don't be afraid to be the one who asks.   Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support.   Look for specialized support groups.

It may be easier to reach for unhealthier comfort foods and snacks while you spend more time at home but try to keep a balanced approach. When you stock up on groceries don’t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables—we still have everything we need to prepare food. Now that we're advised to limit the amount of time we spend in public spaces like grocery stores this is a great time to try out new fruits and vegetables that keep at home for longer periods of time.   If it's safer for you to stay home or you are in selfisolation reach out for help. Many grocery stores and meal prep services offer safe nocontact delivery. You can also ask family or friends to bring you groceries or look for local COVID19 support groups on social media. It's safest if others leave food and other supplies outside of your door to avoid spreading the virus.   Exercise is an important part of mental health and wellbeing stress management and health sleep. However it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed.   If it's safe for you to do so spend time outside. You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others but there is no reason to avoid walks runs or other safe outdoor activities. Note that some municipalities BC Parks and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures—they're just keeping everyone safe.   If you prefer to exercise indoors you can also find many different exercises classes online. You can try yoga follow a barre class work on your cardio pick up a new dumbbell routine and keep up with Crossfit WODs from the comfort of your living room. Look for noequipment exercise routines or classes if you don't already have equipment.   Poor sleep can make even simple problems feel a lot worse than they really are. Poor sleep can affect your mood your outlook and your patience. Unfortunately stress and anxiety can really take a toll on your sleep. If you're having a hard time sleeping be proactive and practice healthy sleep habits.

People often overestimate the negative parts—their own feelings their own abilities to manage a difficult situation or the situation itself—and underestimate positive parts—their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones their support networks and opportunities.

Challenging negative unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood validate your ability to get through this and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well.   Stop and notice thoughts that come up. How do they make you feel? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation?

Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects—this is normal and expected. However when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse. You\\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term.   These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps. Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time. You\\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed. You\\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\\'re not taking good care of yourself like when you\\'re not eating or sleeping well.   Here are some common thinking traps:   Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen. People who overgeneralize often use words like \"always\" or \"never.\"   I was really looking forward to that concert and now it’s cancelled. This always happens to me! I never get to do fun things!   Seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible. People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure.   I wanted to eat healthier but I ate too many snacks today. This plan is a total failure!   Saying only negative things about yourself or other people.   I made a mistake. I\\'m stupid! My boss told me that I made a mistake. My boss is a total jerk!   Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence.   I\\'ve been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks but I just know that I\\'m going to get sick.   Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive.   I know there\\'s a lot I can do at home but I\\'m just so sick of this. Everything is terrible.   Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation.   I feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better.   Telling yourself how you \"should\" or \"must\" act.   I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying!   Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps. Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills. You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www.heretohelp.bc.ca.   Don\\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way.   This doesn\\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap. When you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind.   Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens:   What is the situation? What actually happened? Only include facts that everyone would agree on.   What are your thoughts? What are you telling yourself?   What are your emotions? How do you feel?   What are your behaviours? How are you reacting? What are you doing to cope?   Take a look at the thoughts you\\'ve listed. Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns? It\\'s common to fall into more than one thinking trap. Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation.   The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts. Use the evidence you\\'ve collected to challenge your thinking traps. Here are some ways to do that:   Try to find evidence against the thought. If you make a mistake at work you might automatically think \"I can\\'t do anything right! I must be a terrible employee!\" When this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking \"Is there any evidence to support this thought? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought?\" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn\\'t support the idea that you\\'re a bad employee.   Ask yourself \"Would I judge other people if they did the same thing? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people?\" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh selfcriticism.   Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts. For example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think \"Good parents wouldn\\'t have this kind of problem.\" To challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they\\'ve ever had any problems with their kids.   Test your beliefs in person. For example if you think that your friends don\\'t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call. If you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you.   Once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps. Let\\'s use the following example:   I feel sad and overwhelmed. I\\'m having a hard time figuring out what to do.   I\\'m the worst! I should be able to handle this!   Labeling   \\'Should\\' statements   Examine the evidence: I have a lot of challenges right now. I\\'m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly. I\\'ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so I know I can do this.   It\\'s okay to feel upset right now—there\\'s a lot going on. I\\'m going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me. I\\'m trying to do a lot on my own so I\\'m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together.

This includes:   Losing security like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent   Losing stability or routine like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures   Losing your sense of safety like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID19   Losing your social relationships like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or selfisolation   Losing hope for the future like feeling that life will never go back to normal   Losing important goals like finding your classes sports competitions or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future   Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings   Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad angry frustrated fearful or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again.   Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey.   Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them such as by talking with a friend writing in a journal or making art.   Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your wellbeing. Let go of expectations tasks or other obligations that can wait.   Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other.   Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and wellbeing can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can try to get enough sleep spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so and exercise regularly. Think about selfcare activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities.   Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass.   Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day coping in unhealthy ways or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor—many now offer online or phone appointments.

              "  'A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications. Some use psychotherapy ‘talk therapies’ approaches like cognitivebehavioural therapy to treat mental health problems. Many psychiatrists work at hospitals clinics or health centres and some have a private office. As they are specialist doctors you will almost always need another doctor’s referral to see a psychiatrist and fees are covered by MSP. If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist.   A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments but they don’t prescribe medication. They have graduate degrees in psychology. There are two different ways to access registered psychologists: the public system and the private system. Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools. You may need a doctor’s referral to access the program and costs are usually covered by MSP. However most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system. To do this you can contact the psychologist yourself—you do not need a referral. Costs are not covered by MSP but they may be covered by employee health plans. A registered psychologist’s fees charged by hour vary and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes.   You’ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated. The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear. When it comes to your treatment and care the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals. Are you really focused on finetuning medications? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach? Does the professional’s philosophy of care make sense to you? Do you like the professional you’re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences? Ultimately your relationship with the professional is what matters. Instead of focusing on designation look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations.   Talk to your family doctor and ask for their recommendations   Ask local mental health organizations for help. You can find local branches through the provincial organizations behind HeretoHelp   Ask a community health centre outpatient psychiatry program or mental health team for suggestions   For a list of psychiatrists near you search under ‘Specialist’ in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia’s Find a Physician Tool but remember that you will first need a referral from a doctor like your family doctor   For a list of psychologists near you search in the British Columbia Psychological Association’s Find a Registered Psychologist tool and you can also learn more about finding a psychologist from the College of Psychologists of British Columbia'),\n",

              "  'Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing. Both are used to describe professionals who use talkbased approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem. Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy including registered psychologists registered clinical counsellors psychiatrists other therapists and counsellors family doctors psychiatric nurses and faith leaders.   It’s useful to talk to someone about any problem—a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better. A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more: they have training experience and emotional distance since they don’t know you. They use different theories to listen to you support you and approach different problems or patterns. For example a psychotherapy called cognitivebehavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions wellbeing and future thoughts and behaviours. A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills.   There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses. A few examples include cognitivebehavioural therapy interpersonal therapy dialectical behaviour therapy solutionsfocused brief psychotherapy narrative therapy and emotionfocused therapy.   In general some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same no matter which approach you choose: the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist’s understanding of the problem and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist. In fact one research review found that 50% of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor called nondirective supportive therapy was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist.1 Psychotherapy can and does work but the professional you choose and their match with your values is also very important.   When you’re looking for a professional it’s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization like those listed in the next section.'),\n",
              " (\"What's the difference between CBT and DBT?\",\n",
              "  'CBT cognitivebehavioural therapy and DBT dialectical behaviour therapy are two forms of psychotherapy or “talk therapy.” In both you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own.   Cognitivebehavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts feelings and behaviours influence each other. For example if you believe that people don’t like you thought you might avoid social situations behaviour and feel lonely feeling. However CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage: a positive change in one factor changing a thought or behaviour can lead to positive changes in all factors. CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems including depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and substance use problems.   CBT is structured shortterm goaloriented and focused on the present. It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you. Next you’ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problemsolving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts feelings and behaviours. You’ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future.   Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT with greater focus on emotional and social aspects. DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours. DBT is an evidencebased approach to help people regulate emotions. It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns particularly selfharm.   Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships. DBT teaches you that your experiences are real and it teaches you how to accept who you are regardless of challenges or difficult experiences. Relationships are also very important in DBT—including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner. You may have frequent checkins to talk about any successes or problems. Treatment may include a mix of oneonone sessions and group sessions. In addition to CBT skills you’ll learn skills around managing your emotions building relationships with others coping well with problems or distress acceptance and mindfulness.   As with many talk therapies it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills. But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature—they are tools that last a lifetime.'),\n",

              "  'There are many different types of antidepressant medications and they each work in different ways. Antidepressants are divided into “classes” based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain called neurotransmitters they are thought to influence. Each class may contain several different medications which each have slightly different ways of working. Below you’ll find common classes and examples of common medications. The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name.   SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine Prozac paroxetine Paxil citalopram Celexa escitalopram Cipralex and sertraline Zoloft   SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors: venlafaxine Effexor and duloxetine Cymbalta   NDRIs or norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitors: bupropion Wellbutrin and Zyban   NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants: mirtazapine Remeron which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant   SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors: trazodone Desyrel   There are other classes of antidepressants such as MAOIs or triclycics that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions. They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don’t work. Other medications such as lithium thyroid medication or antipsychotics may also be prescribed often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect. Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression—they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders.   Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants. If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication. It can be a frustrating process especially when you feel unwell but it’s important to find something that works for you! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people and it’s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first. Everyone responds to them differently. It’s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns—or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works.'),\n",

              "  'If possible bring up your concerns with the professional who provided the diagnosis. That way the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision.   If that doesn’t resolve the situation or a followup appointment isn’t possible you can ask for a second opinion. A second opinion is an assessment from a different professional. This can give you better understanding of what’s going on and what to do about it. Second opinions are common when it comes to major health decisions—you won’t hurt anyone’s feelings and your doctor will try to accommodate reasonable requests for a second opinion. Talk to your family doctor or go to a walkin clinic to discuss your options and get a referral to a different program or health professional if needed.

While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants it’s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect.   Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you. If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects call your pharmacist. You can reach a pharmacist by phone afterhours by calling 811.   It’s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider. While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better it’s important to follow your doctor’s instructions.   In some cases people can have an allergic reaction to a medication. Some reactions are not serious like a rash. In these cases you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help afterhours. If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing dizziness or confusion call 911 right away.   When you start a new medication your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects signs of an allergic reaction how long it might take to work and other information. It’s good information to keep on hand but it isn’t always easy to read. When you pick up your medication you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for.   If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn’t working for you there are many different options! Unfortunately finding the right medication can take some trial and error. Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication and often you need to try something to see if it works or doesn’t work for you. This can be a frustrating process especially when you want to start feeling better but it’s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options. Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals but it’s important to share information so you both understand what’s going on and can make good informed decisions about your health care. Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion but its important information for your doctor and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns.

This can be a tricky situation—you want to help but most adults are responsible for their own care.   There are two important points to think about. First diagnosing a health condition especially when symptomchecking is so easy online can be dangerous. Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture. Remember too that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what’s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life. Second except in rare cases the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment just as they would for any other health problem. If the vast majority of cases you cannot do this work entirely for them—and trying to do so may damage your relationship.   Be honest about your concerns the impacts you are seeing that worry you listen to their point of view and work together to find a solution that works for everyone even if it means a compromise. You may want to offer to go with them to an appointment encourage them to do an online screening selftest or involve someone else close to them who may be similarly concerned and may have more influence in encouraging them to notice changes and seek help. Because you may be feeling frustrated and helpless it’s important to get care and support for yourself during this time especially if you’re very close to the person you’re worried about.   In serious situations the BC Mental Health Act allows someone to be held for a period of time for psychiatric assessment without their consent if they are at risk of harming themselves or others.

How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem but many people say they’re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression. Here are some tips:   You don’t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing you just need to recognize that it’s a difficult experience. You can try something like “I can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you” or “I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling unwell.” If you have experienced depression yourself you might say “I know how you feel.” Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness not comparing symptoms.   You don’t have to be an expert but learning more about depression can help you understand what’s going on and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression. Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start and we have a list of resources at Q&A: Where can I learn more about depression?   Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help—in fact many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard. It’s important to understand that talking about something difficult like experiences of depression can be very hard for your loved one. You cannot force them to talk about it but you can invite them to and create safe and quiet spaces to talk. If a loved one opens up to you listen actively—that is without distractions like your phone or the TV. Really pay attention to what they have to say. Listen with empathy and without judgement. Even if you don’t understand the problem or see the problem in a different way your main concern is the distress or difficult feelings your loved one is experiencing. You can find indepth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once or at all. That’s okay! Respect your loved one’s boundaries and let them tell you what they’re ready to talk about.   Even when you have the best intentions unsolicited advice can be unhelpful. You likely can’t fix the problem and you may not know the whole story. If you’d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you.   Different people need different things—don’t assume you know what’s best! Some people need emotional help like someone they can talk with. Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional but they might need practical help like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan. And others may simply want to be included in some social events. By asking what a person needs you may also be less tempted to give advice.   When people experience an episode of depression they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings. This can take a real toll on others. It’s a good idea to seek support for yourself—there are support groups just for family members and friends. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness.

You can find indepth tips on listening and communicating well in Module Three of the Family Toolkit. Some people are not ready to talk about everything at once or at all. That’s okay! Respect your loved one’s boundaries and let them tell you when they’re ready to talk.   Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations sensations that aren’t real like hearing voices or delusions beliefs that can’t be true like believing that you are being followed by a spy can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan. As a group these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis. Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one’s hallucinations or delusions. It’s best to avoid arguing about these experiences. Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia—they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of. Telling someone that their experiences aren’t real or aren’t true doesn’t help when the experiences feel very real to that person! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up—without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion. For example if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices it isn’t helpful to say something like “You’re okay! It isn’t real. I don’t hear anything.” Instead you might say “I can only image how upsetting that voice must be. I can see the voice makes you feel scared.” Know that with good treatment and support symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance.   Ask how you can help. When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again especially if they have dependent children. These plans such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team. Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help. If you’d like to learn more about planning for care see the BC Schizophrenia Society.   If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis they might need extra help. For example people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact. When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest. Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly while other times it may take a lot of time and effort to get back into routines. Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive. It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one’s tasks or chores yourself but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery. Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities and let them tell you when they need extra help.   Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness—for everyone. During episodes of psychosis your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can’t understand. They may act in ways that you don’t understand. Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings communicate clearly or seem interested in others. It’s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness. They are no one’s fault but they can still be hard to cope with. Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support. The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www.bcss.orgmonthlymeetingscalendar.   As a family member it’s important to take care of yourself. Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities such as your exercise routine and hobbies. Ask another family member or good friend to provide help with caregiving especially in the early days of your loved one's illness. If you need help balancing time for selfcare with caregiving duties check out the BC Schizophrenia Society’s Family Respite Program.   Try to maintain your friendships or the network of people that you have in your life. These will later become important supports as your loved one recovers. Educate them and update them on your loved one's recovery. People are sometimes afraid to ask questions about schizophrenia and this will put them at ease.   This is very important! You are not responsible for your loved one’s treatment unless your loved one is your child under 19 but you can support them. Schizophrenia can make it difficult for people to make and go to appointments and follow their treatment plan. With your loved one’s permission you may choose to help by reminding them of appointments taking them to appointments or whatever helps in your situation. If your loved one isn’t happy with their treatment or would like to try a new approach you can encourage them to talk with their care team like their doctor or mental health team—it can be dangerous to stop or change a treatment without a doctor’s support.   Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones. It’s hard to see someone you love in pain. You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing. You want to help. But in order for any treatment to work your loved one needs to be active in their care. Forcing or threatening treatment generally doesn’t work or if it does in the case of an emergency only for a short time and can often hurt everyone involved. In most cases anyone 19 years of age and older and not at risk of harm is free to make their own choices. And their choices may include refusing treatment or choosing a treatment that you disagree with. It helps everyone if you can be respectful and keep honest communication open between you. You can learn more about dealing with this situation in Q&A: An adult in my life seems ill and won’t find help. What can I do?.

              "  'Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms. Young people use cannabis like other psychoactive drugs to feel good to feel better to do better or to explore. Trying cannabis out of curiosity as an experiment or while socializing with friends is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm. Using cannabis to cope with daily life deal with unpleasant feelings or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm. This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends.   Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use the greater the potential for harms. The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19. However our brains do not finish developing until about age 25. Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain.   Some young people especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues should probably not use cannabis. Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people. Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed. As in most situations balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns.   Mixing drugs such as cannabis and alcohol can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms. Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are. We often suggest “Not too much not too often and only in a safe context” as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance.   As a parent or caring adult an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use. Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis other substances or anything else of concern to them says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them. This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person’s way in life!

              "  '‘Mental health’ and ‘mental illness’ are increasingly being used as if they mean the same thing but they do not. Everyone has mental health just like everyone has health. As the World Health Organization famously says “There is no health without mental health.” In the course of a lifetime not all people will experience a mental illness but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental wellbeing i.e. their mental health just like we all have challenges with our physical wellbeing from time to time.   When we talk about mental health we’re talking about our mental wellbeing: our emotions our thoughts and feelings our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties our social connections and our understanding of the world around us.   A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think feel behave or interact with others. There are many different mental illnesses and they have different symptoms that impact peoples’ lives in different ways.   Health isn’t like an onoff switch. There are different degrees of health. People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to soso health to poor health to illness or disability. For example some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives. Some people experience serious health problems and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life. Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly. Many people fall somewhere in the middle—they’re generally in good health though the occasional problem may come up. Mental health is the same way.   Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness people may have poor mental health without a mental illness. We all have days where we feel a bit down or stressed out or overwhelmed by something that’s happening in our lives. An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically. Good mental health isn’t about feeling happy and confident 100% of time and ignoring any problems. It’s about living and coping well despite problems.   Just as it’s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness it’s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness. That’s because mental illnesses like other health problems are often episodic meaning there are times ‘episodes’ of ill health and times of better or good health.   With the right supports and tools anyone can live well—however they define well—and find meaning contribute to their communities and work towards their goals.'),\n",

Anxiety is one of our internal warning systems that alerts us to danger or other threats and prepares our bodies to fight back or get out of a dangerous situation. Scientists call this the ‘fight flight or freeze’ response.   A manageable amount of anxiety from time to time can be helpful. For example it can motivate you to prepare for a test a school or finish a task at work. Even happy events like moving to a new home or celebrating an important milestone can bring up anxiety—all of this is just part of being human.   Anxiety is a problem when it becomes overwhelming or unmanageable and it comes up unexpectedly. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses that have a big impact your life. People may avoid going about their daily lives in order to avoid anxiety. They may experience a lot of uncomfortable physical sensations and physical health problems. Many people say that they know their anxiety isn’t based in reality but they feel ‘trapped’ by their thought and feelings. Anxiety disorders can be treated.

Stress is related to the same ‘fight flight or freeze’ response as anxiety and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar.   The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we’re finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed we usually know what we’re stressed about and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over.   Anxiety on the other hand isn’t always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

              "  'People tend to use the word “addiction” to mean very different things. “I am addicted to shopping” might mean only that the speaker likes to shop. On the other hand “He is addicted” might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour. When people use the word about psychoactive mindaltering substances like alcohol tobacco or other drugs they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour.   The evidence however suggests a quite different picture. While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations. Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine for example. Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies. In fact substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons: to feel good to feel better to improve performance for culturalspiritual reasons and to have new experiences.   Substance use is more complicated than just “good” or “bad.” It’s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum from beneficial use to harmful use. Along the middle of the continuum substance use may be both beneficial and harmful. You have an enjoyable night out with friends but feel a little ill the next day. At the far end of the continuum some people develop dependence—they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties problems at home or at work health problems or legal problems.   In general substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others—and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations. The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems. For instance if a person uses a substance to have fun only occasional social use may follow. But when a person uses a substance to cope with a longterm problem such as social anxiety then more long lasting and intense use may follow. Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us. The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle—not too much not too often and only in safe contexts.'),\n",

Those of us who drink seek benefits from alcohol not difficulties. But sometimes we start using more and more often than makes sense. As a general rule drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others. Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol “all day every day.” But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired.   What’s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts i.e. places times and activities and over time e.g. coping with chronic problems. You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada’s LowRisk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app. This short simple screen can be used by people of all ages.   All alcohol use involves some risk. The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems. For instance if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations only occasional social use may follow. But when a person drinks to cope with a longterm problem such as social anxiety then more long lasting and intense use may follow.   By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death your chances for longterm health consequences such as cancer or heart disease and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms.   Whenever you decide to drink alcohol it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible. The following are some useful guidelines to consider.   Not too much. Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours.   Tip: Drink slowly and alternate between nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages.   Not too often. Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time.   Tip: Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week avoiding drinking on some days.   Only in safe contexts. Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcoholrelated harm.   Tip: If going to a bar stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options.

However the risk of developing some cancers e.g. mouth tongue and lung is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users. And while all drugs have an effect on the brain the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences. The negative effects of cannabis on the brain for example seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol.   Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms. The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it. Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17 2018. Adults over age 19 in BC are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public. Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch. Cannabis will be tested for quality.   When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking. This helps us manage the risks. However it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system. It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold mildew or fillers that may be toxic.   The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities. When dealing with complex issues like cannabis policy no one has all the answers. But as community members we all have thoughts feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other. Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use as individuals and communities in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm.

              "  \"You can't. But you can influence their capacity to make good choices in a world where alcohol and other drugs are available. It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life. It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship so they know where to go with questions or problems.   Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child. Inviting and allowing open honest conversation about drugs or any other subject makes your child know that what they are thinking feeling and experiencing matters to you. The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings.   When young people are asked thoughtful openended questions exploring what they think it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour. This process of selfreflection is part of developing critical thinking skills a part of good decisionmaking. Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs. Once young people have considered something carefully they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence.   There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start. Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture. They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising. This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day.   Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use. This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home. While young adults have more independence and more legal rights parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas.

              " ('What is the legal status (and evidence) of CBD oil?',\n",
              "  \"Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis. It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use. CBD is not psychoactive and does not produce the ‘high’ of THC tetrahyrocannabinol the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions.   All cannabinoids including CBD produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system. The human body also produces its own cannabinoids. It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors. Instead it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD.   Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain. Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis. There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders. The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety moodrelated symptoms pain and insomnia.   After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy in 2018 the United States FDA approved CBD Epidiolex as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures. Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice.   There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know and thus slow progression of the illness. Again more research is needed in this area.   Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs although nothing significant has yet been recorded. CBD has been found to be generally safe. Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common. As with any other treatment it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use.

              " ('What is the evidence on vaping?',\n",
              "  '\"Vaping\" is the term for using a device where liquids often flavoured are turned into vapour hence vaping and inhaled. A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece tank or reservoir to hold the liquid a heating element and a battery to power the element. The liquid is heated to become a mist inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream. Any residual vapour is exhaled. Vaping devices come in several types shapes and sizes referred to as ecigarettes vape pens vapes mods tanks or ehookahs. Vaping liquid eliquid ejuice consists of a solvent usually propylene glycol or glycerol flavour and nicotine or cannabis though it may not contain anything. In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products.   The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years while vaping has increased. Ecigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking. The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette. Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes. Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests it may help some people quit smoking. Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco.   Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes vaping still carries potential harms. There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour. A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer. Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine. Ecigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands. Other chemicals flavourings and heavy metals present in vaping liquids have not as yet been well studied. Longterm health risks from vaping are thus undetermined. More research is needed in these areas.   Marketing strategies for vaping products often on social media are designed to appeal to young people. The range of flavours available especially those that are fruity and sweet and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth. Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and \\'smoke\\' in a less harmful way.   Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed each other in making good decisions about if when or how much to vape. We offer \"not too much not too often and in a safe context\" as one way to think about using any substance. What this means to you may be a place for talking to start!

We all have to step up during a pandemic because we all have a part to play in reducing the spread of the virus . It's important that you know what must be done and how you should do it . This is important for the health of your neighbours and your own mental health and taking action can help counter difficult feelings like hopelessness and despair . One study from people in China found that people who had reliable uptodate information about the coronavirus and COVID19 illness and accurate instructions on how they should act such as instructions around handwashing and wearing a mask felt more resilient and felt better able to handle the virus . People who received good accurate information reported lower levels of stress anxiety and depression . This research is available for free at www . mdpi . com166046011751729 . Of course it's okay to set limits . Staying informed does not mean that you have to follow the news all day . Check in a few times a day sticking to trusted sources and media outlets .

Here are key points to keep in mind as you determine which information is worth considering and which information doesn\\'t pass the test . It\\'s so easy to spread information online and we can\\'t assume that the source we\\'re reading or watching is the original source . Before you can evaluate anything you need to know where the claims come from and determine if it\\'s a reliable source . Reliable sources on the coronavirus and COVID19 illness include the World Health Organization WHO Government of Canada ministries and agencies like Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada the Government of BC ministries and agencies like the BC Ministry of Health and the BC Centre for Disease Control BCCDC . Scientists and researchers at universities and other institutions and health sciences professionals are also important sources of information . Headlines and titles need to be simple and short so they can sometimes be misleading on their own . They may also be purposefully shocking or controversial to entice you to click to read more . Websites that belong to governments governmentfunded agencies wellknown health providers universities or groups of medical professionals are generally the most reliable . Be careful of sites that don\\'t list the author or don\\'t tell you much about themselves . Doublecheck the author and the credentials of any \\'experts\\' quoted or cited to see if they are actually experts in the topic being discussed . Can you find other evidence from other sources to support the claims ? Does the author list their sources ? Are the sources legitimate like research journals ? Unhelpful sources want you to feel a certain way : scared angry distrustful vulnerable . Phrases like \" Skyrocketing rates of infection \" are sensational and they\\'re meant to make people feel afraid . On the other hand factual statements like \" We have 50 new cases in BC \" give you important information without playing into your emotions . Helpful news or information sources want you feel informed and empowered . Who is paying for the site ? What products or services are being advertised ? What links or other sites do they promote ? Are you learning something from a story or experience or are you simply being directed to buy a product or service ? Social media can be a great way to keep in touch with family and friends especially as we practice physical distancing or selfisolation . Social media can also be an important way to learn from health experts and connect to support services and mutual aid groups in your community . Like any other source of information it\\'s important to use good critical thinking skills when you use social media . Studies find that searching for health information on social media generally has very mixed results . You\\'ll see both very poorquality sources next to goodquality sources and it\\'s up to you to decide which is which . In addition social media posts tend to be short and rarely capture everything you need to consider . They are generally useful as a way to start learning or exploring different points of view rather than a place to gather all the information .

This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own . While measures like physical distancing and selfisolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear . Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you . For example you might prefer a video chat over a phone call or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call . Then work with your social networks to make a plan . You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week . Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online . Check in by phone and ask how you can help . The quality of your social connections matter .

When you stock up on groceries don ’ t ignore fresh fruit and vegetables — we still have everything we need to prepare food .

Exercise is an important part of mental health and wellbeing stress management and health sleep . However it's something that many people give up when they start to feel stressed or overwhelmed . If it's safe for you to do so spend time outside . You should still avoid busy areas or groups and stay at least two metres away from others but there is no reason to avoid walks runs or other safe outdoor activities . Note that some municipalities BC Parks and Parks Canada have restricted some outdoor spaces to reduce crowds so check the status of your local parks or trails and respect closures — they're just keeping everyone safe .

When we feel stressed out angry or fearful it\\'s hard to look at the situation realistically and see all of the options we have . Remember : we all control our own actions and reactions no matter what\\'s going on in the world . We can call do something about this pandemic . People often overestimate the negative parts — their own feelings their own abilities to manage a difficult situation or the situation itself — and underestimate positive parts — their own abilities to care for themselves and loved ones their support networks and opportunities . How does the thought \" We\\'re never going to make it through this ! \" make you feel ? It likely doesn\\'t feel good — and it isn\\'t even true . Challenging negative unhelpful thoughts can improve your mood validate your ability to get through this and help you see new options or opportunities to stay well . Stop and notice thoughts that come up . How do they make you feel ? Do your thoughts seem realistic if you look at the situation more objectively ? How can you reframe the thought to make it more productive or hopeful ? Can you find any positive aspects or think of new ways to approach the situation ? Here are a few example : \" I\\'m so mad that my event was cancelled ! This sucks ! \" \" I know this is the safer option for everyone . When it\\'s rescheduled I\\'ll enjoy it more because I won\\'t have to worry about getting sick or spreading the illness . \" \" I hate spending so much time at home . This is so boring . \" \" I\\'m doing my part to keep my neighbours safe . It\\'s worth it because it keeps people healthy . \" \" I\\'m having a hard time getting used to my new schedule .

I feel so overwhelmed right now . \" \" It makes sense that I feel scared — people are getting sick and we don\\'t know when things will go back to normal . But there are a lot of things I can do to keep healthy and I\\'m going to do some research so I can do my best . When I focus on the things I can do everything feels more manageable . \" \" We\\'re going to be stuck inside forever . I\\'m already sick of this . \" \" I understand that it will take some time to manage COVID19 and I trust that health care professionals and scientists are working as fast as they can . I know this will end eventually and life will go back to normal . \" The goal is not to ignore the bad or uncomfortable parts of the situation or deny that there\\'s a problem .

              " '<START> What you tell yourself about a situation affects how you feel and what you do . Sometimes your interpretation of a situation can get distorted and you only focus on the negative aspects — this is normal and expected . However when you interpret situations too negatively you might feel worse . You\\'re also more likely to respond to the situation in ways that are unhelpful in the long term . These automatic thoughts and assumptions are sometimes called thinking traps . Everyone falls into unbalanced thinking traps from time to time . You\\'re most likely to distort your interpretation of things when you already feel sad angry anxious depressed or stressed . You\\'re also more vulnerable to thinking traps when you\\'re not taking good care of yourself like when you\\'re not eating or sleeping well . Here are some common thinking traps : Thinking that a negative situation is part of a constant cycle of bad things that happen . People who overgeneralize often use words like \" always \" or \" never . \" I was really looking forward to that concert and now it ’ s cancelled . This always happens to me ! I never get to do fun things ! Seeing things as only right or wrong good or bad perfect or terrible . People who think in black and white terms see a small mistake as a total failure . I wanted to eat healthier but I ate too many snacks today . This plan is a total failure ! Saying only negative things about yourself or other people . I made a mistake . I\\'m stupid ! My boss told me that I made a mistake . My boss is a total jerk ! Predicting that something bad will happen without any evidence . I\\'ve been doing what I can to stay home and reduce the risks but I just know that I\\'m going to get sick . Focusing only on the negative parts of a situation and ignoring anything good or positive . I know there\\'s a lot I can do at home but I\\'m just so sick of this . Everything is terrible . Believing that bad feelings or emotions reflect the situation . I feel scared and overwhelmed right now so that must mean everything is very bad and will never get better . Telling yourself how you \" should \" or \" must \" act . I should be able to handle this without getting upset and crying ! Here are helpful strategies to challenge common thinking traps . Many people find their mood and confidence improve after working through these skills . You can also find worksheets to help you go through each step at www . heretohelp . bc . ca . Don\\'t try to get out of a thinking trap by just telling yourself to stop thinking that way . This doesn\\'t let you look at the evidence and challenge the thinking trap . When you try and push upsetting thoughts away they are more likely to keep popping back into your mind . Ask yourself the following questions when something upsetting happens : What is the situation ? What actually happened ? Only include facts that everyone would agree on . What are your thoughts ? What are you telling yourself ? What are your emotions ? How do you feel ? What are your behaviours ? How are you reacting ? What are you doing to cope ? Take a look at the thoughts you\\'ve listed . Are you using any of the thinking traps and falling into distorted thinking patterns ? It\\'s common to fall into more than one thinking trap . Go back to the thinking trap list and identify which ones apply to you and your current situation . The best way to break a thinking trap is to look at your thoughts like a scientist and consider the hard facts . Use the evidence you\\'ve collected to challenge your thinking traps . Here are some ways to do that : Try to find evidence against the thought . If you make a mistake at work you might automatically think \" I can\\'t do anything right ! I must be a terrible employee ! \" When this thought comes up you might challenge it by asking \" Is there any evidence to support this thought ? Is there any evidence to disprove this thought ? \" You might quickly realize that your boss has complimented your work recently which doesn\\'t support the idea that you\\'re a bad employee . Ask yourself \" Would I judge other people if they did the same thing ? Am I being harder on myself than I am on other people ? \" This is a great method for challenging thinking traps that involve harsh selfcriticism . Find out whether other people you trust agree with your thoughts . For example you might have trouble with one of your kids and think \" Good parents wouldn\\'t have this kind of problem . \" To challenge this thought you can ask other parents if they\\'ve ever had any problems with their kids . Test your beliefs in person . For example if you think that your friends don\\'t care about you call a few friends and make plans to start a regular video call . If you assumed that they will all say no you may be pleasantly surprised to hear that they do want to see you . Once you have worked through some challenges try to think of a more balanced thought to replace the old thinking traps . Let\\'s use the following example : I feel sad and overwhelmed . I\\'m having a hard time figuring out what to do . I\\'m the worst ! I should be able to handle this ! Labeling \\'Should\\' statements Examine the evidence : I have a lot of challenges right now . I\\'m worried about my family and everything seems to change so quickly . I\\'ve successfully handled complicated situations in the past so I know I can do this . It\\'s okay to feel upset right now — there\\'s a lot going on . I\\'m going to think about how I got through past situations and see what worked for me . I\\'m trying to do a lot on my own so I\\'m going to talk to my family so we can make a plan and work together .

              " '<START> A psychiatrist is a medical doctor with extra training in mental health who can choose to prescribe medications . Some use psychotherapy ‘ talk therapies ’ approaches like cognitivebehavioural therapy to treat mental health problems . Many psychiatrists work at hospitals clinics or health centres and some have a private office . As they are specialist doctors you will almost always need another doctor ’ s referral to see a psychiatrist and fees are covered by MSP . If you have a valid BC Services or CareCard you do not need to pay to see a psychiatrist . A registered psychologist focuses on different talk therapy or counselling approaches to treatments but they don ’ t prescribe medication . They have graduate degrees in psychology . There are two different ways to access registered psychologists : the public system and the private system . Registered psychologists in the public system work in some hospitals or schools . You may need a doctor ’ s referral to access the program and costs are usually covered by MSP . However most people need to access registered psychologists through the private system . To do this you can contact the psychologist yourself — you do not need a referral . Costs are not covered by MSP but they may be covered by employee health plans . A registered psychologist ’ s fees charged by hour vary and some offer lower fees to people with lower incomes . You ’ ve probably noticed that a lot of the differences come down to how you pay for different services and how these professionals are educated . The practical differences in how they work are not always so clear . When it comes to your treatment and care the most important part is finding a professional who supports your own goals . Are you really focused on finetuning medications ? Are you looking for a particular therapy approach ? Does the professional ’ s philosophy of care make sense to you ? Do you like the professional you ’ re talking to and do you feel safe sharing your experiences ? Ultimately your relationship with the professional is what matters . Instead of focusing on designation look for a professional who meets your needs and your expectations .

              " '<START> Psychotherapy and counselling have a lot in common and usually mean the same thing . Both are used to describe professionals who use talkbased approaches to help someone recover from a mental illness or mental health problem . Many different professionals may provide counselling or psychotherapy including registered psychologists registered clinical counsellors psychiatrists other therapists and counsellors family doctors psychiatric nurses and faith leaders . It ’ s useful to talk to someone about any problem — a lot of people find that simply talking with friends or family can help them feel better . A professional therapist or counsellor can offer more : they have training experience and emotional distance since they don ’ t know you . They use different theories to listen to you support you and approach different problems or patterns . For example a psychotherapy called cognitivebehavioural therapy is based on the theory that learning skills to change your thinking and actions can positively impact your emotions wellbeing and future thoughts and behaviours . A therapist could help you learn and practice these skills . There are many psychotherapies with good evidence of being effective for different problems or illnesses . A few examples include cognitivebehavioural therapy interpersonal therapy dialectical behaviour therapy solutionsfocused brief psychotherapy narrative therapy and emotionfocused therapy . In general some aspects of therapy and counselling are the same no matter which approach you choose : the expectations you bring to your counselling sessions the match between your understanding of the problems and your therapist ’ s understanding of the problem and the trust and rapport that you have with your therapist . In fact one research review found that 50 % of the improvement seen in clients who just received active listening and support from a counsellor called nondirective supportive therapy was due simply to the relationship between client and therapist . 1 Psychotherapy can and does work but the professional you choose and their match with your values is also very important . When you ’ re looking for a professional it ’ s always a good idea to ask if they are a member of a professional organization like those listed in the next section . <END>',\n",
              " '<START> CBT cognitivebehavioural therapy and DBT dialectical behaviour therapy are two forms of psychotherapy or “ talk therapy . ” In both you work with a mental health professional to learn more about the challenges you experience and learn skills to help you manage challenges on your own . Cognitivebehavioural therapy or CBT teaches you how your thoughts feelings and behaviours influence each other . For example if you believe that people don ’ t like you thought you might avoid social situations behaviour and feel lonely feeling . However CBT teaches you how to use these relationships to your advantage : a positive change in one factor changing a thought or behaviour can lead to positive changes in all factors . CBT is an approach that has been proven by research to work for many different mental health problems including depression anxiety disorders eating disorders and substance use problems . CBT is structured shortterm goaloriented and focused on the present . It starts with education around the particular mental illness or challenge and how the illness or challenge affects you . Next you ’ ll learn and practice skills and strategies like problemsolving or realistic thinking to help you make changes in your thoughts feelings and behaviours . You ’ ll learn how you can use your new skills to deal with problems in the future . Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT is based on CBT with greater focus on emotional and social aspects . DBT was developed to help people cope with extreme or unstable emotions and harmful behaviours . DBT is an evidencebased approach to help people regulate emotions . It started as a treatment for borderline personality disorder and current research shows it may help with many different mental illnesses or concerns particularly selfharm . Key differences between CBT and DBT are validation and relationships . DBT teaches you that your experiences are real and it teaches you how to accept who you are regardless of challenges or difficult experiences . Relationships are also very important in DBT — including the relationships between you and your DBT practitioner . You may have frequent checkins to talk about any successes or problems . Treatment may include a mix of oneonone sessions and group sessions . In addition to CBT skills you ’ ll learn skills around managing your emotions building relationships with others coping well with problems or distress acceptance and mindfulness . As with many talk therapies it takes time and effort to enjoy the benefits of CBT and DBT skills . But once people master skills with support from your CBT or DBT therapist they often find that their new skills and strategies become second nature — they are tools that last a lifetime . <END>',\n",
              " '<START> There are many different types of antidepressant medications and they each work in different ways . Antidepressants are divided into “ classes ” based on what they do and which chemical messengers in the brain called neurotransmitters they are thought to influence . Each class may contain several different medications which each have slightly different ways of working . Below you ’ ll find common classes and examples of common medications . The first name is the generic name and name in brackets is the brand name . SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors : fluoxetine Prozac paroxetine Paxil citalopram Celexa escitalopram Cipralex and sertraline Zoloft SNRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors : venlafaxine Effexor and duloxetine Cymbalta NDRIs or norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitors : bupropion Wellbutrin and Zyban NaSSAs or noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants : mirtazapine Remeron which can also be classed as a TeCa or tetracyclic antidepressant SARIs or serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors : trazodone Desyrel There are other classes of antidepressants such as MAOIs or triclycics that are much older and have more side effects or restrictions . They are usually prescribed when newer antidepressants don ’ t work . Other medications such as lithium thyroid medication or antipsychotics may also be prescribed often in combination with an antidepressant to boost its effect . Antidepressants are not only used to treat depression — they may be prescribed to treat other illnesses like anxiety disorders . Only medical doctors like family doctors or psychiatrists can prescribe antidepressants . If your doctor recommends that you consider antidepressants keep in mind that most people have to try a few different options before they find the right medication . It can be a frustrating process especially when you feel unwell but it ’ s important to find something that works for you ! Side effects and benefits can vary significantly between different people and it ’ s difficult to predict how a medication might work without trying it out first . Everyone responds to them differently . It ’ s very important to have ongoing discussions with your health care team regarding your medication so you can bring up any problems or concerns — or even ask more about how your particular antidepressant works . <END>',\n",
              " '<START> If possible bring up your concerns with the professional who provided the diagnosis . That way the professional can answer your questions and you can better understand their decision . If that doesn ’ t resolve the situation or a followup appointment isn ’ t possible you can ask for a second opinion . A second opinion is an assessment from a different professional . This can give you better understanding of what ’ s going on and what to do about it . Second opinions are common when it comes to major health decisions — you won ’ t hurt anyone ’ s feelings and your doctor will try to accommodate reasonable requests for a second opinion . Talk to your family doctor or go to a walkin clinic to discuss your options and get a referral to a different program or health professional if needed .

              " '<START> If you ’ re concerned about your medications it ’ s important to talk with the doctor or psychiatrist who prescribed your medications . While it can take a few weeks to really see improvements with many antidepressants it ’ s still a good idea to talk to your doctor about what to expect . Talk to the doctor that prescribed your medication if you experience symptoms or side effects that are distressing you . If you want to talk to a trusted professional about the most common side effects call your pharmacist . You can reach a pharmacist by phone afterhours by calling 811 . It ’ s also best not to stop taking the medication or changing the dose on your own without first talking to a health care provider . While it might be tempting to stop taking your medication when you start feel better it ’ s important to follow your doctor ’ s instructions . In some cases people can have an allergic reaction to a medication . Some reactions are not serious like a rash . In these cases you can call the pharmacist or call 811 to reach help afterhours . If you have a serious reaction like difficult breathing dizziness or confusion call 911 right away . When you start a new medication your pharmacist will give you a printout with information like side effects signs of an allergic reaction how long it might take to work and other information . It ’ s good information to keep on hand but it isn ’ t always easy to read . When you pick up your medication you can ask the pharmacist to go over the information with you so you understand what you should look for . If a particular antidepressant or psychiatric medication just isn ’ t working for you there are many different options ! Unfortunately finding the right medication can take some trial and error . Different people can have very different experiences with the same medication and often you need to try something to see if it works or doesn ’ t work for you . This can be a frustrating process especially when you want to start feeling better but it ’ s important to keep trying and work with your doctor so you understand your options . Many people feel intimidated talking to health professionals but it ’ s important to share information so you both understand what ’ s going on and can make good informed decisions about your health care . Some people also feel embarrassed talking about symptoms or side effects like changes in sex drive or digestion but its important information for your doctor and they know that changes in sex drive or digestion are common concerns .

This can be a tricky situation — you want to help but most adults are responsible for their own care . There are two important points to think about . First diagnosing a health condition especially when symptomchecking is so easy online can be dangerous . Diagnosis is still always best left to professionals who can look at the whole picture . Remember too that the person you care about may have a very different idea of what ’ s causing their difficulties and what the negative impacts are on their life . Second except in rare cases the person being treated needs to be an active player in their own recovery to continue with their treatment just as they would for any other health problem .

How we can or should help may seem fairly obvious when a loved one experiences a physical health problem but many people say they ’ re not sure how to best help when a loved one experiences a mental illness like depression . Here are some tips : You don ’ t have to understand exactly what someone else is experiencing you just need to recognize that it ’ s a difficult experience . You can try something like “ I can see that this experience or these symptoms are really painful for you ” or “ I ’ m sorry to hear that you ’ re feeling unwell . ” If you have experienced depression yourself you might say “ I know how you feel . ” Just remember that everyone experiences illnesses like depression differently and empathy is about recognizing the impact of the illness not comparing symptoms . You don ’ t have to be an expert but learning more about depression can help you understand what ’ s going on and maybe dispel some of the unhelpful myths around depression . Our Depression info sheet is a great place to start and we have a list of resources at Q & A : Where can I learn more about depression ? Sometimes talking about problems or concerns can really help — in fact many people who experience a mood disorder say that they just want to be heard .

If a loved one opens up to you listen actively — that is without distractions like your phone or the TV . Really pay attention to what they have to say . Listen with empathy and without judgement .

Respect your loved one ’ s boundaries and let them tell you what they ’ re ready to talk about . Even when you have the best intentions unsolicited advice can be unhelpful . You likely can ’ t fix the problem and you may not know the whole story . If you ’ d like to share what worked for you in a similar situation you can ask if the other person would like to talk about strategies that worked for you . Different people need different things — don ’ t assume you know what ’ s best ! Some people need emotional help like someone they can talk with . Other people may have a good relationship with a counsellor or other professional but they might need practical help like help around the house or help sticking to their treatment plan . And others may simply want to be included in some social events . By asking what a person needs you may also be less tempted to give advice . When people experience an episode of depression they can have a lot of very negative thoughts and feelings . This can take a real toll on others . It ’ s a good idea to seek support for yourself — there are support groups just for family members and friends . The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of family support groups around BC for any mental illness .

Respect your loved one ’ s boundaries and let them tell you when they ’ re ready to talk . Symptoms of schizophrenia like hallucinations sensations that aren ’ t real like hearing voices or delusions beliefs that can ’ t be true like believing that you are being followed by a spy can take some time to stop even when people are receiving treatment and following their treatment plan . As a group these very distressing symptoms are called psychosis . Many people have a hard time responding to a loved one ’ s hallucinations or delusions . It ’ s best to avoid arguing about these experiences . Remember that delusion are symptoms of schizophrenia — they are not thoughts that you can talk someone out of . Telling someone that their experiences aren ’ t real or aren ’ t true doesn ’ t help when the experiences feel very real to that person ! A better approach is to empathize with the feelings that hallucinations or delusions bring up — without confirming or denying the hallucination or delusion . For example if a loved one is frustrated or upset when they hear voices it isn ’ t helpful to say something like “ You ’ re okay ! It isn ’ t real . I don ’ t hear anything . ” Instead you might say “ I can only image how upsetting that voice must be . I can see the voice makes you feel scared . ” Know that with good treatment and support symptoms like hallucinations and delusions become much easier for people to manage and lose importance . Ask how you can help . When people experience a serious mental illness like schizophrenia they may want to plan how they can take action if they start to feel unwell again especially if they have dependent children . These plans such as advanced directives or Ulysses Agreements are made when a person feels well and are meant to communicate their wishes to loved ones and their care team . Ask your loved one if they have a plan in place so you know what they need if they need help . If you ’ d like to learn more about planning for care see the BC Schizophrenia Society . If a loved one is experiencing an episode of psychosis or is recovering for an episode of psychosis they might need extra help . For example people who are actively experiencing hallucinations or delusions might need a lot of personal space and feel uncomfortable being around a lot of people or even making eye contact . When people are recovering from an episode of psychosis they may need a quiet space and a lot of rest . Sometimes people can get back into their usual routines fairly quickly while other times it may take a lot of time and effort to get back into routines . Keep in mind that too much help can be a bit counterproductive . It may well be faster and easier for you to take care of your loved one ’ s tasks or chores yourself but rebuilding activity and confidence are a big part of recovery . Encourage and support your loved one as they take on daily responsibilities and let them tell you when they need extra help . Schizophrenia can be a difficult illness — for everyone . During episodes of psychosis your loved one may experience frightening sensations that you can ’ t understand . They may act in ways that you don ’ t understand . Other symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard for people to express emotions or feelings communicate clearly or seem interested in others . It ’ s important to know that these are symptoms of an illness . They are no one ’ s fault but they can still be hard to cope with . Consider reaching out to a family and friends support group for your own support . The BC Schizophrenia Society has a directory of groups around BC at www . bcss . orgmonthlymeetingscalendar . As a family member it ’ s important to take care of yourself . Try to maintain your regular schedule and activities such as your exercise routine and hobbies .

Treatment can be a difficult area for loved ones . It ’ s hard to see someone you love in pain . You might be scared of the things your loved one is experiencing . You want to help . But in order for any treatment to work your loved one needs to be active in their care .

              " '<START> Using cannabis has the potential for benefits and harms . Young people use cannabis like other psychoactive drugs to feel good to feel better to do better or to explore . Trying cannabis out of curiosity as an experiment or while socializing with friends is related to moderate use and lower potential for harm . Using cannabis to cope with daily life deal with unpleasant feelings or fit in with a social group has higher potential for harm . This is because dealing with these kinds of issues is associated with frequent and heavier use less thought about potential harms and little consideration of alternatives for coping such as talking with a parent or trusted adult or physical activity with friends . Evidence suggests that the younger a person is when they start using cannabis and the more often they use the greater the potential for harms . The legal age to use cannabis in BC is 19 . However our brains do not finish developing until about age 25 . Delaying cannabis use until early adulthood may reduce potential harmful effects on the brain . Some young people especially those with many factors predisposing them to serious and persistent mental health issues should probably not use cannabis . Cannabis has been associated with an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia in this small group of people . Some people with serious mental health issues have also reported that using cannabis has helped them cope with their illness by helping them feel less anxious or stressed . As in most situations balancing potential benefits and harms of using cannabis will be key for young people who have serious mental health concerns . Mixing drugs such as cannabis and alcohol can also increase the possibility of experiencing harms . Intoxication may be more intense and long lasting and the young person may not appreciate how impaired they are . We often suggest “ Not too much not too often and only in a safe context ” as a simple way to gauge your use of any psychoactive substance . As a parent or caring adult an open respectful relationship with a young person is one of your best resources and ways to prevent harms from substance use . Letting the youth know they can approach you at any time to talk about cannabis other substances or anything else of concern to them says they matter to you and you are ready to listen and engage in dialogue with them . This is a great place to begin addressing anything that might come the young person ’ s way in life ! The Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research formerly CARBC is a member of the BC Partners for Mental Health and Addictions Information .

Everyone has mental health just like everyone has health . As the World Health Organization famously says “ There is no health without mental health . ” In the course of a lifetime not all people will experience a mental illness but everyone will struggle or have a challenge with their mental wellbeing i . e . their mental health just like we all have challenges with our physical wellbeing from time to time . When we talk about mental health we ’ re talking about our mental wellbeing : our emotions our thoughts and feelings our ability to solve problems and overcome difficulties our social connections and our understanding of the world around us . A mental illness is an illness the affects that way people think feel behave or interact with others . There are many different mental illnesses and they have different symptoms that impact peoples ’ lives in different ways . Health isn ’ t like an onoff switch . There are different degrees of health . People move on a continuum ranging from great or good health to soso health to poor health to illness or disability . For example some people have good health and have no problems going about their lives . Some people experience serious health problems and their poor health has a very negative impact on their life . Some people have serious health problems that last for a long time and others have serious health problems that resolve very quickly . Many people fall somewhere in the middle — they ’ re generally in good health though the occasional problem may come up . Mental health is the same way . Just as someone who feels unwell may not have a serious illness people may have poor mental health without a mental illness . We all have days where we feel a bit down or stressed out or overwhelmed by something that ’ s happening in our lives . An important part of good mental health is the ability to look at problems or concerns realistically . Good mental health isn ’ t about feeling happy and confident 100 % of time and ignoring any problems . It ’ s about living and coping well despite problems . Just as it ’ s possible to have poor mental health but no mental illness it ’ s entirely possible to have good mental health even with a diagnosis of a mental illness . That ’ s because mental illnesses like other health problems are often episodic meaning there are times ‘ episodes ’ of ill health and times of better or good health .

The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different however . Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we ’ re finding hard to cope with . When we are stressed we usually know what we ’ re stressed about and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over . Anxiety on the other hand isn ’ t always as easy to figure out . Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself .

ASPD is treatable and it may improve as a person approaches middle age . All of us have hurt someone else or acted without thinking of others' needed . It ’ s important to remember that antisocial personality disorder is an enduring pattern around lack of empathy and lack of remorse .

              " '<START> A personality disorder is a pattern of thoughts feelings and behaviours that last for a long time and causes some sort of problem or distress . Obsessivecompulsive personality disorder or OCPD is about control . People with OCPD have very inflexible thinking and expect everything to be ordered perfect and done their \" correct \" way . This happens at the expense of other important things in life including relationships with others . Work can take priority over every other part of life too and people with OCPD may seem excessively dedicated but may be unable to complete tasks due to perfectionism . They may struggle to delegate and may distrust other people ’ s contributions . People with OCPD may not tolerate uncertainty and may have a very rigid understanding of the world — something is either right or wrong . They may also have a hard time spending money on themselves or others and they may experience hoarding the inability to throw away items from their homes . The conflict between the desire for neatness or order and the inability to throw things out may cause a lot of anxiety . While obsessivecompulsive personality disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD have a similar name they are not the same illness . People with obsessivecompulsive disorder usually understand that their obsessions and compulsions are illogical and usually experience a lot of distress even though they may not be able to stop obsessions or compulsions . Compulsions are an attempt to reduce anxiety not to find pleasure . People with obsessivecompulsive personality disorder may view their thoughts as part of who they are see their thoughts as logical and may find pleasure or benefit in completing compulsive tasks . They may experience a lot of distress when they can ’ t achieve control or the perfectionism they want . Obsessivecompulsive personality disorder is one of the most common personality disorders . Treatment may include some combination of psychotherapy medication and selfhelp strategies .

It involves episodes of eating a lot of food in a short amount of time past the point of feeling full and feelings of being out of control or unable to stop eating . People who experience bingeeating disorder may binge even when they don ’ t feel hungry . They may feel temporarily comforted by food and then feel depressed upset guilty or ashamed of their eating . As a result many people try to keep bingeeating symptoms a secret . You can ’ t tell if someone experiences bingeeating disorder just from the way they look or the way they eat around others . While a lot of people have the experience of eating too much a few times and feeling uncomfortable after people who experience bingeeating disorder experience many binges for a long period of time .

Schizophrenia does mean “ split mind ” but the name was meant to describe the ‘ split ’ from reality that you experience during an episode of psychosis as well as changes in thoughts emotions and other functions . Dissociative identity disorder on the other hand does cause a split or fragmented understanding of a person ’ s sense of themselves . Dissociative identity disorder is really more about fragmented identities than many different personalities that develop on their own . Most people see different parts of their being as part of the whole person . For people who experience DID identity fragments may have very different characteristics including their own history identity and mannerisms . A key part of DID is dissociation — feeling detached to the world around you . People who experience DID may have many unexplainable gaps in their memory forget information they ’ re already learned or have difficulties recalling things they ’ ve said or done . Unlike portrayals of DID on TV or in movies DID may not be obvious to others and it can take a lot of time to come to the diagnosis . Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that causes hallucinations sensations that aren ’ t real and delusions beliefs that can ’ t possibly be true in addition to other symptoms like jumbled thoughts jumbled speech and difficulties expressing emotions . People who experience schizophrenia may hear or feel things that aren ’ t real or believe things that can ’ t be real but these aren ’ t separate identities . <END>',\n",

Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions . Hallucinations are sensations that are not real such as hearing voices or sounds that aren ’ t real . Hearing voices is a common hallucination but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense — hearing sight smell taste or touch . Delusions are strong beliefs that can ’ t possibly be true . Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities . Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating completing tasks or making decisions . Thoughts may feel ‘ jumbled ’ or confused . Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly . Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions . Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis but schizophrenia also has other symptoms . And it isn ’ t the only cause of psychosis . In some cases other mental illnesses cause psychosis including depression bipolar disorder dementia and borderline personality disorder . Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress a major lack of sleep or trauma . People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis . Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury neurological problem or other health problem . So while psychosis can be a part of schizophrenia it can be caused by many other things too . Psychosis and schizophrenia are treatable . It ’ s important to seek help as soon as possible . <END>',\n",

              " '<START> People tend to use the word “ addiction ” to mean very different things . “ I am addicted to shopping ” might mean only that the speaker likes to shop . On the other hand “ He is addicted ” might mean the speaker thinks the other person is completely unable to control his own behaviour . When people use the word about psychoactive mindaltering substances like alcohol tobacco or other drugs they often assume these drugs are dangerous and have the power to control human behaviour . The evidence however suggests a quite different picture . While substance use can clearly contribute to health and social problems substances can be beneficial for some people in some situations . Many people celebrate a special occasion with a nice glass of wine for example . Some people use tobacco as a powerful symbol in cultural and spiritual ceremonies . In fact substances have been used by humans throughout history for many reasons : to feel good to feel better to improve performance for culturalspiritual reasons and to have new experiences . Substance use is more complicated than just “ good ” or “ bad . ” It ’ s helpful to think of substance use along a continuum from beneficial use to harmful use . Along the middle of the continuum substance use may be both beneficial and harmful . You have an enjoyable night out with friends but feel a little ill the next day . At the far end of the continuum some people develop dependence — they need to continually use the drug in order to feel normal and will keep using even when that leads to financial difficulties problems at home or at work health problems or legal problems . In general substance use is a problem when it causes problems for you or others — and how much use causes problems will be different for different people in different situations . The reason a person uses a substance influences the risk of developing problems . For instance if a person uses a substance to have fun only occasional social use may follow . But when a person uses a substance to cope with a longterm problem such as social anxiety then more long lasting and intense use may follow . Managing our risk involves being aware of why we are using and what impacts our use is having on ourselves and those around us . The wisdom of our ancestors suggests a guiding principle — not too much not too often and only in safe contexts . <END>',\n",
              " '<START> Seeking to make changes in the way you use substances like alcohol or other drugs ? This can be an important step ! Some people are able to reduce their substance use or quit altogether on their own or with selfhelp materials . But most of us need support from other people — family members friends health professionals or other people struggling with substance use problems . The right help for you depends on many factors . These include the type of drug you are using how much and how often your health and social situation and of course your own preferences . Getting help doesn ’ t mean giving up control of shaping your own path . You are still the one who makes the final decisions about the type and degree of change you make . One way to get help is to talk to a doctor you trust and feel comfortable confiding in . If you aren ’ t comfortable talking in person you can also get advice from a registered nurse along with advice on programs or services in your area by calling HealthLink BC at 811 . Since some drugs are illegal many people worry about what might happen if they talk about drug use .

              " '<START> Sorting out if you are drinking too much can be complicated . You are unique and your relationship with alcohol is unique . No one has the same combination of life experiences and influences that you do . So even though you and your friend may choose to drink how and why you use alcohol may be different . Those of us who drink seek benefits from alcohol not difficulties . But sometimes we start using more and more often than makes sense . As a general rule drinking alcohol becomes a problem when it negatively affects our life or the lives of others . Many people imagine this refers to people who consume alcohol “ all day every day . ” But even drinking too much on a single occasion can lead to a problem for instance making a poor decision such as driving while impaired . What ’ s also important to recognize is the potential for negative consequences related to drinking in various contexts i . e . places times and activities and over time e . g . coping with chronic problems . You can get personalized feedback related to your pattern of drinking as compared to Canada ’ s LowRisk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines via the Alcohol Reality Check screening app . This short simple screen can be used by people of all ages . All alcohol use involves some risk . The reasons people use alcohol can influence their risk of developing problems . For instance if a person uses alcohol to enhance special celebrations only occasional social use may follow . But when a person drinks to cope with a longterm problem such as social anxiety then more long lasting and intense use may follow . By reflecting on your pattern of drinking you can manage your risk for immediate injury or death your chances for longterm health consequences such as cancer or heart disease and your risk of developing habitual patterns of drinking that may lead to these harms . Whenever you decide to drink alcohol it is helpful to know what steps you can take to ensure that your drinking behaviour is the most rewarding and least harmful possible . The following are some useful guidelines to consider . Not too much . Managing how much you drink on a given occasion helps decrease risky behaviours . Tip : Drink slowly and alternate between nonalcoholic and alcoholic beverages . Not too often . Drinking in moderation helps to reduce harms to ourselves and others over time . Tip : Keep less alcohol at home and set limits on how much you are going to drink each week avoiding drinking on some days . Only in safe contexts . Making informed decisions about where you drink helps to minimize alcoholrelated harm . Tip : If going to a bar stay with a group and choose an establishment that is well lit and near safe transportation options .

However the risk of developing some cancers e . g . mouth tongue and lung is less for cannabis smokers than tobacco smokers partly because they tend to smoke less than tobacco users . And while all drugs have an effect on the brain the particular properties of the drug influence the level of risk of harmful consequences . The negative effects of cannabis on the brain for example seem to be less than the effects of some substances such as alcohol . Legalizing cannabis provides an opportunity to put in place regulations to minimize potential harms . The danger of buying and using any illegal drug is that we can never know for sure what exactly is in it . Cannabis is legal in Canada as of October 17 2018 . Adults over age 19 in BC are now permitted to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis in public . Cannabis is regulated by the Province of British Columbia and will be sold through the Liquor Distribution Branch . Cannabis will be tested for quality . When drugs are produced and obtained inside a regulated system it is possible for us to know about the contents and dosage of what we are taking . This helps us manage the risks . However it is likely that cannabis will still be available outside the government system . It is important to know that the quality of cannabis obtained from a dealer or a friend is unknown and may contain contaminants like mold mildew or fillers that may be toxic . The legalization of cannabis also provides us with openings to engage in honest and thoughtful discussions about drug use with our families and communities . When dealing with complex issues like cannabis policy no one has all the answers . But as community members we all have thoughts feelings and experiences around drugs and drug use to share with each other . Engaging together to explore and share ideas will help us discover how to manage use as individuals and communities in ways that maximize benefit and minimize harm .

It's about helping your child develop the skills to assess what might be helpful in achieving their goals in life . It's also about nourishing a supportive relationship so they know where to go with questions or problems . Opening up a discussion about drugs can help strengthen your relationship with your child . Inviting and allowing open honest conversation about drugs or any other subject makes your child know that what they are thinking feeling and experiencing matters to you . The goal is to get your child talking and sharing their thoughts and feelings . When young people are asked thoughtful openended questions exploring what they think it helps them become interested in their own thoughts and behaviour . This process of selfreflection is part of developing critical thinking skills a part of good decisionmaking . Critical thinking skills are actually an essential part of reducing the risks related to using drugs . Once young people have considered something carefully they are a lot less likely to act out of impulse or in response to influence . There is no rule about how or where a conversation about alcohol or other drugs should start . Even young children know drugs are a part of our culture . They see people drinking around them and are exposed to drugs on TV and in advertising . This makes it a subject that can be brought up naturally while getting ready for a family celebration where alcohol will be present or if you are planning to visit a relative who uses tobacco or while swapping stories at the dinner table about what happened at work and school that day . Talking with teens and young adults about drugs as they make choices on the path into adulthood helps them to develop personal standards minimize risks and critically assess popular beliefs about drug use . This can be particularly important as they transition to the legal age for using alcohol or cannabis and move out of the family home . While young adults have more independence and more legal rights parents can continue to be an important sounding board on which to try out their thoughts and ideas .

              " \"<START> Cannabidiol or CBD is a naturally occurring component of cannabis . It is extracted from the cannabis plant and often made into an oil for use . CBD is not psychoactive and does not produce the ‘ high ’ of THC tetrahyrocannabinol the primary psychoactive component of cannabis . CBD is legal in Canada and has been used in the treatment of various medical conditions . All cannabinoids including CBD produce effects in the body by attaching to certain receptors in the brain or immune system . The human body also produces its own cannabinoids . It seems that CBD does not attach directly to receptors . Instead it directs the body to use more of its own cannabinoids to produce the therapeutic effects associated with CBD . Research suggests that CBD may provide relief for chronic pain . Sativex is a proprietary medication that combines THC and CBD and may be prescribed for the relief of pain associated with multiple sclerosis . There is also some evidence suggesting that CBD may be a promising support for people with opioid use disorders . The researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders including anxiety moodrelated symptoms pain and insomnia . After researching the safety and effectiveness of CBD oil for treating epilepsy in 2018 the United States FDA approved CBD Epidiolex as a therapy for two rare conditions characterized by epileptic seizures . Other evidence suggests that CBD may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia though further research is needed before introducing CBD into medical practice . There is some initial evidence that CBD may help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease keep the ability to recognize the faces of people that they know and thus slow progression of the illness . Again more research is needed in this area . Because of the way cannabis and its products are metabolized scientists believe there is a potential for interaction with other drugs although nothing significant has yet been recorded . CBD has been found to be generally safe . Reports from patients indicate that negative drug interactions are not common . As with any other treatment it is important to monitor your use of CBD and seek assistance if you experience any problems or have questions or concerns about its use .

              " '<START> \" Vaping \" is the term for using a device where liquids often flavoured are turned into vapour hence vaping and inhaled . A vaping device consists of a mouthpiece tank or reservoir to hold the liquid a heating element and a battery to power the element . The liquid is heated to become a mist inhaled through the mouth into the lungs where the nicotine or cannabis enters the bloodstream . Any residual vapour is exhaled . Vaping devices come in several types shapes and sizes referred to as ecigarettes vape pens vapes mods tanks or ehookahs . Vaping liquid eliquid ejuice consists of a solvent usually propylene glycol or glycerol flavour and nicotine or cannabis though it may not contain anything . In British Columbia you must be 19 years old to buy vaping products . The number of young people who smoke cigarettes has declined over the past few years while vaping has increased . Ecigarettes were developed as an alternative to smoking . The first devices were available in 2003 and looked much like a traditional cigarette . Nicotine vapour contains significantly fewer toxins and other particles than smoke from cigarettes . Vaping is a less harmful alternative to cigarettes and evidence suggests it may help some people quit smoking . Evidence suggests vaping is likely not a gateway to smoking tobacco . Though less harmful than smoking cigarettes vaping still carries potential harms . There is a small exposure to nicotine and possible carcinogens in the vapour . A carcinogen is a substance that has the potential to cause cancer . Some evidence suggests that young people may be unaware the vaping liquid often contains nicotine . Ecigarettes are not controlled and the nicotine content of vaping liquids varies significantly among brands . Other chemicals flavourings and heavy metals present in vaping liquids have not as yet been well studied . Longterm health risks from vaping are thus undetermined . More research is needed in these areas . Marketing strategies for vaping products often on social media are designed to appeal to young people . The range of flavours available especially those that are fruity and sweet and the look and feel of vaping devices attract youth . Young people can see vaping as fun and a way to socialize with friends and \\'smoke\\' in a less harmful way . Making the time and space for discussion and exploring the issues around vaping is one important way we can support young people and indeed each other in making good decisions about if when or how much to vape . We offer \" not too much not too often and in a safe context \" as one way to think about using any substance . What this means to you may be a place for talking to start !
